<p>An earned media AEO strategy is your plan to use PR-driven placements, press coverage, and third-party mentions so that AI answer engines cite your brand. In 2026, that is no longer optional. <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/state-of-aeo-geo-report/">Conductor's survey of 250+ digital leaders</a> found that 97% reported a positive impact from AEO and GEO in 2025, and 94% plan to increase their investment in 2026. The same research shows that <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/aeo-geo-benchmarks-report/">visitors from LLMs convert at twice the rate in one-third the number of sessions</a> compared with traditional channels. Earned media is the highest-leverage asset for AEO and GEO because AI engines cite third-party coverage far more than brand-owned content.</p>

<h2>What Is an Earned Media AEO Strategy?</h2>

<p>An earned media AEO strategy is a PR-first plan to secure press coverage, reviews, and third-party mentions in publications that AI answer engines like Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Gemini crawl and cite. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) focuses on zero-click answers and direct citations; GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) targets visibility in generative AI results. In practice, both rely on the same asset: authoritative, citable, third-party content. Earned media is that asset. Your strategy maps how you will create coverage worth citing, build relationships with journalists and outlets AI engines trust, and measure success in citations and AI referral traffic.</p>

<h2>Why Earned Media Dominates AEO and GEO</h2>

<p>AI answer engines are built to prefer credible, third-party sources. <a href="https://www.britopian.com/research/earned-media-dominates-ai-search/">Research summarized by Michael Brito (Zeno Group) from University of Toronto work</a> shows that AI engines cite earned media far more than brand-owned sites. That creates a clear hierarchy: the more strong earned coverage you have, the more often you appear in AI answers.</p>

<p>Conductor's 2026 data sharpens the business case. Enterprises allocated an average of <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/state-of-aeo-geo-report/">12% of their digital budgets to AEO and GEO in 2025</a>, and 94% of CMOs and digital leaders plan to raise that investment in 2026. The payoff is measurable: Conductor's benchmarks indicate that <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/aeo-geo-benchmarks-report/">traffic from AI converts at twice the rate in one-third the sessions</a> versus other sources. Earned media does not only drive traditional PR metrics; it directly feeds the channel where conversion rates are highest.

<p>On the PR side, <a href="https://www.cision.com/resources/guides-and-reports/2025-comms-report/">Cision's 2025 Comms Report</a> found that 30% of PR professionals are relying more on earned media than in the prior year. The shift toward earned media and the shift toward AEO/GEO are aligning: the best AEO strategy is one that treats earned media as the primary input.

<h2>The GEO and AEO Hybrid: One Visibility System</h2>

<p>GEO and AEO are often discussed separately, but they share the same dependency: content that AI systems are willing to cite. GEO emphasizes optimization for generative engines and answer-style results; AEO emphasizes zero-click, answer-first formats. In both cases, the limiting factor is whether your brand appears in third-party, editorially trusted content. Earned media is that content.</p>

<p>A single earned media AEO strategy can serve both. You focus on placements in publications that rank well for both classic SEO and AI citation, you structure stories so they answer common questions, and you use data and expert voices so answers are quotable. One playbook, two engines.</p>

<h2>Building Your Earned Media AEO Strategy in Five Steps</h2>

<h3>1. Prioritize Placements in Publications AI Engines Cite</h3>

<p>Not all earned media is equal for AEO. Prioritize Tier 1 and high-authority outlets that AI engines regularly crawl and cite: major business press, top trade publications, and trusted vertical media. A byline in a well-cited publication is worth more for AI visibility than several mentions in low-authority domains.

<h3>2. Create and Pitch Content That Answers Questions</h3>

<p>AEO rewards content that directly answers the questions users type into Perplexity, ChatGPT, or Gemini. Shape pitches and story angles around clear, answerable questions in your space. Use headlines and lead paragraphs that could slot into an AI-generated answer.</p>

<h3>3. Make Answers Quotable with Data and Experts</h3>

<p>AI systems are more likely to cite precise statistics, definitions, and expert quotes. Work data from research, surveys, or your own studies into pitches and placed stories. Attribute claims to named experts or studies and link to primary sources where possible.</p>

<h3>4. Align PR with Performance and Citations</h3>

<p>Traditional retainers often focus on activity, not outcomes. Data from the industry indicates that <a href="https://www.authoritytech.io/blog/results-based-pr-outcome-focused-model-measurable-roi-2026">performance-based PR delivers roughly 3x better ROI</a> than retainer models, while many retainer clients churn within six months when results are unclear. Choose a PR model that rewards placements and, where possible, structures engagements so you pay for citable outcomes.</p>

<h3>5. Measure Citations and AI Referral Traffic</h3>

<p>Track which placements are cited in AI answers, which queries trigger those citations, and how much referral traffic and conversions come from AI. Use Conductor-style benchmarks (e.g., conversion rate and sessions to convert) to compare AI-sourced traffic to other channels.</p>

<h2>Why a PR-First Approach Beats SEO-Only AEO</h2>

<p>An SEO-only AEO strategy concentrates on on-site and technical optimization. That helps, but AI engines still favor third-party, editorial content over brand-owned pages. A PR-first earned media AEO strategy builds the very corpus that gets cited: articles, quotes, and data in respected publications. You are not only optimizing for AI; you are creating the source material AI is designed to cite.</p>

<p>Performance PR sharpens that edge. When your PR partner is paid for placements, incentives align with AEO: more high-quality, citable earned media. The 70% churn pattern common in retainer PR reflects misaligned incentives; a performance model ties compensation to the outcomes that also drive AEO and GEO.</p>
