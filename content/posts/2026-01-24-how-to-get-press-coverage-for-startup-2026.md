<p>Startups need press coverage to build credibility, attract customers, and support fundraising. Yet most advice skips the numbers. The reality: only 3.15% of PR pitches get any response, and retainers often run $10,000 or more per month for a handful of stories. This guide uses recent data on pitch response rates and PR costs, plus a clear 5-step process, to help you earn press coverage for your startup. We also cover when a performance-based model makes more sense than a retainer.</p>

<h2>What Counts as Press Coverage (and What's Newsworthy)</h2>

<p>Press coverage for startups means earned mentions in third-party outlets, such as Forbes, TechCrunch, industry trades, or podcasts. You earn it through pitching, relationships, and newsworthy milestones. It is not paid advertising or sponsored content.</p>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
</div>

<p>Before you pitch, you need real news. The main categories that get covered are: product launches and features, product or sales milestones (e.g., 1M users, $100K MRR), significant partnerships or customer wins, and fundraising rounds. Generic company profiles rarely get picked up. Resources like <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4c-getting-press-for-your-startup">Y Combinator's guide to getting press</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marenbannon/2021/04/08/how-to-get-media-coverage-for-your-startup-launch/">Forbes</a> stress that reporters want news, not backgrounders.</p>

<h2>The Data: Pitch Response Rates and PR Costs</h2>

<p>Data from the past two years makes the case for a focused, relationship-driven approach instead of spray-and-pray.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>3.15% response rate:</strong> <a href="https://www.propelmypr.com/blog/journalist-responses-overall-are-still-under-3-research-shows">Propel's research</a> and <a href="https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/report-journalists-respond-to-315-of-pitches-podcast-pitch-volume-surges-by-22-789482a">industry reports</a> show that only about 3.15% of pitches get any response. That includes rejections, not just coverage.</li>
<li><strong>45% of pitches opened:</strong> According to <a href="https://www.prdaily.com/by-the-numbers-this-is-how-many-pitches-actually-get-responses/">PR Daily</a>, only around 45% of pitches are even opened. Short, relevant subject lines and tight lists matter.</li>
<li><strong>6:1 PR-to-journalist ratio:</strong> <a href="https://www.prdaily.com/by-the-numbers-this-is-how-many-pitches-actually-get-responses/">PR Daily</a> notes that there are more than six PR professionals for every journalist. Inboxes are overloaded, so targeting and relevance are critical.</li>
<li><strong>Retainers from $3,500 to $50,000+ per month:</strong> <a href="https://www.axiapr.com/blog/real-cost-of-hiring-a-pr-firm">Axia PR</a> and <a href="https://clutch.co/pr-firms/pricing">Clutch</a> report that PR retainers typically range from about $3,500 for boutique work to $50,000 or more for top-tier firms. Mid-market programs often run $10,000 to $12,000 per month for 3 to 5 stories.</li>
<li><strong>68% of retainers lack placement metrics:</strong> Industry analysis, including discussions of retainer value and transparency, indicates that a majority of PR retainers do not tie fees to placement or outcomes. You may pay monthly without clear guarantees. <a href="https://www.axiapr.com/blog/real-cost-of-hiring-a-pr-firm">Axia's overview of PR costs</a> outlines what to expect and what to ask for.</li>

<h2>How to Get Press Coverage for Your Startup in 5 Steps</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Create Real News</h3>

<p>Launch a product or feature, hit a milestone (users, revenue, retention), close a notable partnership, or announce funding. If you do not have news, create a hook (e.g., original data, a trend) that is timely. Avoid pitching a general company story; it rarely gets coverage.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Build a Targeted Media List</h3>

<p>Search Google News and industry outlets for journalists who already cover your space. Build a list of 20 to 50: publication, name, contact, beat, and recent articles. Tools and databases can help, but a small, well-researched list outperforms a large, generic one. Update it as beats and bylines change. Learning <a href="https://blog.authoritytech.io/how-to-get-featured-in-forbes-complete-strategy-2026">how to get featured in Forbes</a> requires understanding specific journalist beats and editorial calendars.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Pitch Like Business Development</h3>

<p>Treat PR like biz dev: warm introductions beat cold emails. Where possible, get introduced by a mutual connection. If you go cold, keep subject lines very short (1 to 5 words). <a href="https://www.propelmypr.com/research/the-propel-media-barometer---q1-2024">Propel's data</a> suggests short subject lines get roughly double the response of longer ones. First paragraph: 81 to 100 words. Lead with the news and why it matters to their audience. No long bios or attachments in the first email.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Become a Source First</h3>

<p>Help journalists with their stories before you ask for coverage. Offer data, quotes, or context on your market. When you later pitch, they are more likely to open and reply. This is a medium-term play but one that YC and others emphasize.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Track and Iterate</h3>

<p>Note what gets opened, what gets a reply, and what gets placed. Prune the list, test subject lines and angles, and double down on what works. Reuse and adapt winning pitches for similar stories.</p>

<h2>Why Performance-Based PR Fits Startups</h2>

<p>Retainers can work, but many startups overpay for vague deliverables. With 68% of retainers lacking clear placement metrics and response rates under 3.15%, the risk is on you. <a href="https://blog.authoritytech.io/pr-retainer-trap-brands-overpay-underperformance">The PR retainer trap</a> explains why traditional agencies charge monthly fees for activity rather than outcomes.</p>

<p>Performance-based PR flips that: you pay when you get placed. AuthorityTech, for example, guarantees Tier 1 placements in outlets like Forbes, TechCrunch, and The Wall Street Journal, or you pay nothing. We do the outreach, pitching, and relationship-building, and we optimize earned media for AI search so placements are more likely to be cited in tools like Perplexity and ChatGPT. <a href="https://blog.authoritytech.io/how-to-appear-in-chatgpt-answers-earned-media-strategy-2026">How to appear in ChatGPT answers</a> requires strategic placement in publications AI engines trust.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What counts as newsworthy for startup press coverage?</h3>
<p>Journalists cover product launches, significant milestones (1M users, $100K MRR, major partnerships), and fundraising announcements. Generic company profiles rarely get picked up. If you lack traditional news, create a hook through original research, timely industry analysis, or contrarian perspectives backed by data. Y Combinator and Forbes both stress that reporters want news, not backgrounders. With only 3.15% of pitches getting responses, your angle must provide clear reader value.</p>

<h3>Why do most startup PR pitches fail?</h3>
<p>Only 3.15% of PR pitches get any response, and 45% are never even opened. There are 6+ PR professionals for every journalist, creating inbox overload. Most pitches fail because they lack relevance (47% of journalists say pitches don't match their beat), use long subject lines (short 1-5 word subjects get 2x response), or lead with company background instead of news. Spray-and-pray approaches waste runway without building media relationships.</p>

<h3>How much does startup PR cost in 2026?</h3>
<p>Traditional PR retainers range from $3,500 (boutique) to $50,000+ (top-tier) per month, with mid-market programs at $10K-$12K monthly for 3-5 stories. However, 68% of retainers lack clear placement metrics or guarantees. Six-month minimums mean $21K-$60K committed spend with no outcome assurance. Performance-based PR models eliminate this risk by charging only for guaranteed placements — if no placement happens, you pay nothing.</p>

<h3>When should startups invest in PR?</h3>
<p>Timing depends on traction and news. Pre-seed/seed startups should focus on founder thought leadership, not product PR, since you likely lack compelling usage data. Series A companies with product-market fit can pursue product coverage using customer wins and growth metrics. Wait until you have real news — premature PR burns runway on coverage that generates no lasting business impact. Understanding when to invest helps avoid the retainer trap.</p>

<h3>What's the difference between traditional and performance-based PR?</h3>
<p>Traditional retainers charge monthly fees ($3,500-$50,000+) for activity — pitches sent, calls held, strategy sessions — whether placements happen or not. Agencies get paid regardless of outcomes. Performance-based PR charges only for guaranteed placements in specific publications (Forbes, TechCrunch, WSJ). If the placement doesn't happen, you pay nothing. This aligns incentives: the platform succeeds only when you get published, converting uncertain marketing spend into predictable cost-per-outcome.</p>

<p><em>Press coverage for startups comes down to news, a tight media list, and relationship-style pitching. Use the data on response rates and costs to set expectations and to choose between DIY, retainer, and performance-based models. For guaranteed outcomes, performance-based PR is built for startups that prefer to pay for results, not activity.</em></p>
