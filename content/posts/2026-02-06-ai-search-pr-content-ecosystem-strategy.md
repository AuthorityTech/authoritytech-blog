<p><strong>The PR industry just had its "we need to talk" moment.</strong> On February 5, 2026, Notified—one of the world's largest PR distribution platforms—announced an emergency webinar with Ragan on "How AI Search Is Changing PR Content." The message? Press releases alone are no longer enough to show up in AI-generated answers. PR teams need to build what they're calling a "connected mix of content" that includes press releases, corporate newsrooms, FAQs, thought leadership, and earned media working together.</p>

<p>If this sounds familiar, it should. At AuthorityTech, we've been teaching this exact approach for months. While the industry is just waking up to the reality that AI search has fundamentally changed how brands get discovered, we've already built our platform around it. The panic you're seeing in February 2026 webinar announcements? That's validation that we were right all along.</p>

<h2>Why Press Releases Lost Their Solo Power</h2>

<p>Press releases aren't dead. But their role has fundamentally changed. According to research from Notified released in December 2025, press release citations in AI engines grew 5x between July and November 2025—but here's the critical insight: <strong>structure plays a decisive role in what AI models choose to cite</strong>. A press release with structured data, original quotes, and current metadata is 3.4× more likely to appear in AI-generated citations than one without these elements.</p>

<p>The problem? Most PR teams are still writing releases for journalists, not for AI engines. <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/02/3198248/0/en/Earned-Media-Still-Drives-Generative-AI-Citations-as-Press-Release-Visibility-Grows.html">Notified's research</a> found that while press release visibility is growing, <strong>earned media still drives the majority of generative AI citations</strong>. AI models primarily cite earned media from credible news outlets first, followed by press releases from trusted commercial newswires.</p>

<p>This creates a chicken-and-egg problem for PR teams. You need press releases to generate earned media. But AI engines increasingly trust earned media more than press releases alone. The solution isn't to choose one or the other—it's to build a content ecosystem where each piece reinforces the others.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.notified.com/blog/why-does-ai-prefer-press-releases">Notified explains in their recent analysis</a>, press releases remain valuable because they offer structured, verified content that AI systems can easily parse. But they work best as the anchor—not the entirety—of your AI search strategy.</p>

<h2>The Connected Content Ecosystem: What Notified Is Now Teaching</h2>

<p>In their February 12, 2026 webinar announcement, Notified and Ragan outlined what they call an "always-on PR content ecosystem." According to the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/05/3233049/0/en/How-AI-Search-Is-Changing-PR-Content-and-What-You-Should-Do-Next.html">webinar description</a>, this ecosystem includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Press releases</strong> as the structural anchor</li>
<li><strong>Corporate newsrooms</strong> that provide always-available context</li>
<li><strong>FAQs</strong> that answer common questions directly</li>
<li><strong>Thought leadership</strong> that establishes authority</li>
<li><strong>Earned media</strong> that validates your narrative</li>
</ul>

<p>The webinar promises to teach PR teams "how to apply the SOAR Content Framework™ to improve authority and earn citations in AI search." The SOAR Framework, which Notified launched in November 2025, is their methodology for optimizing communications for AI discovery through structured content, original sources, and authority signals.</p>

<p>Here's what makes this announcement significant: <strong>One of the industry's largest platforms is telling tens of thousands of PR professionals that their current approach is insufficient.</strong> This isn't a minor optimization. It's a fundamental rethinking of how PR content needs to work.</p>

<p>And if you're just hearing about this now, you're already behind.</p>

<h2>Why Structured Content Wins AI Citations</h2>

<p>The rise of answer engine optimization (AEO) and generative engine optimization (GEO) has created a new priority for PR teams: making content machine-readable. According to <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/digiday-research-the-marketers-guide-to-ai-applications-agentic-ai-ai-search-and-geo-aeo-in-2026/">Digiday's 2026 marketing research</a>, 34% of marketers are now optimizing their content by highlighting answers to potential consumer questions—the highest percentage of any GEO/AEO strategy surveyed.</p>

<p>But structure goes beyond just FAQ formatting. <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/aeo-geo-benchmarks-report/">Conductor's 2026 AEO/GEO Benchmarks Report</a> found that brands need to move "beyond traditional website analytics to provide key context for evaluating your brand's total search performance and relevance by identifying the latest benchmarks for AI search, AI Overviews, and organic traffic."</p>

<p>In practical terms, this means:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schema markup</strong> that tells AI engines exactly what your content contains</li>
<li><strong>Structured data fields</strong> for key facts, named sources, and "as of" dates</li>
<li><strong>Clear hierarchical information</strong> (H2s, H3s, bullet lists, tables)</li>
<li><strong>Quotable soundbites</strong> that AI engines can extract and cite</li>
<li><strong>Specific statistics</strong> with sources and dates</li>
</ul>

<p>According to <a href="https://superprompt.com/blog/press-releases-5x-more-ai-citations-new-pr-playbook-2026">Superprompt's analysis</a>, recency matters significantly: 50% of AI citations come from content less than 11 months old. This means your content ecosystem needs regular updates, not just quarterly press releases.

<h2>The Zero-Click Search Problem Nobody's Talking About</h2>

<p>Here's the uncomfortable truth driving this industry rethink: even when your content is perfectly optimized, you might not get the click. Zero-click search—where users find their answer directly in the search results page without clicking through—is accelerating with AI-generated answers.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/digiday-research-the-marketers-guide-to-ai-applications-agentic-ai-ai-search-and-geo-aeo-in-2026/">Digiday's research</a>, 37% of brand and agency professionals have seen decreases in upper-funnel search traffic as a result of AI, with 21% seeing decreases in lower-funnel traffic. A December 2024 survey by Bain and Dynata found that 80% of users relied on AI summaries at least 40% of the time, leading to an estimated organic traffic decrease between 15% and 25%.</p>

<p>This is why the connected content ecosystem matters. If users aren't clicking through to your website, you need AI engines to cite your brand name, quote your executives, and reference your authority in their answers. That only happens when you have multiple content types reinforcing the same narrative across different contexts.</p>

<p>As Jen Cornwell, senior director of AI, SEO and innovation at performance marketing agency Tinuiti, <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/digiday-research-the-marketers-guide-to-ai-applications-agentic-ai-ai-search-and-geo-aeo-in-2026/">explained to Digiday</a>, "We've moved into zero-click, where there is minimal attribution for visibility inside of one of the AI search platforms. Yes, you can get a citation. You could get a link and look at your referral traffic, but that is what we're assuming. It is a fraction of the visibility that some of these brands are getting."</p>

<p>Translation: You're being mentioned far more than you realize—but you're not getting credit for it unless you're actively tracking AI citations, not just web traffic.</p>

<h2>Earned Media Gets the Algorithm's Vote</h2>

<p>If there's one takeaway from the recent wave of AI search research, it's this: <strong>earned media carries stronger authority signals than any content you create yourself.</strong> According to <a href="https://www.axiapr.com/blog/do-news-releases-influence-ai-visibility">Axia Public Relations' analysis</a>, "AI models primarily cite earned media from credible news outlets, followed by press releases from trusted commercial newswires. Both offer structured, verifiable data, but earned media carries stronger authority signals that AI systems heavily favor."</p>

<p>This is why the Notified/Ragan webinar emphasizes earned media as part of the content mix. Press releases can generate earned media. Corporate newsrooms provide context that journalists reference. FAQs answer the questions reporters have. Thought leadership establishes the expertise that makes sources quotable. It's a flywheel, not a linear process.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/digiday-research-the-marketers-guide-to-ai-applications-agentic-ai-ai-search-and-geo-aeo-in-2026/">Tinuiti's Cornwell noted</a>, "All of the LLMs eat this diet of earned media and I predict a larger investment in earned media. In 2026, I think we'll see a larger influence in LLMs from organic social."</p>

<p>The implication? PR teams that focus exclusively on press release distribution are missing the majority of their AI visibility opportunity. You need journalists to write about you. You need industry publications to reference you. You need authoritative sources to link to you. And you need all of this to happen consistently, not just during product launches.

<h2>What AuthorityTech Has Been Teaching All Along</h2>

<p>While Notified schedules their webinar, let's be clear about something: <strong>This isn't new information for AuthorityTech users.</strong> Our platform has been built around the premise that AI search requires a fundamentally different PR approach since day one.</p>

<p>When we talk about "AI-native earned media," we're not talking about press releases alone. We're talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Structured press releases</strong> with schema markup and AI-optimized formatting</li>
<li><strong>Citation tracking</strong> across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude</li>
<li><strong>Content ecosystem analysis</strong> that identifies gaps in your always-on presence</li>
<li><strong>Earned media monitoring</strong> that shows which publications AI engines trust most</li>
<li><strong>Authority signal optimization</strong> that makes your brand more citable</li>
</ul>

<p>We didn't wait for industry leaders to validate this approach. We built the platform that executes it.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.vertu.com/lifestyle/seo-is-evolving-the-definitive-guide-to-aio-geo-and-aeo-in-2026/">VERTU's 2026 AI search strategy guide</a>, the distinction between different optimization approaches matters: "GEO (Generative Engine Optimization): A broader strategy aimed at getting your brand cited, mentioned, and trusted by Generative Engines such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini. It prioritizes 'citation' over 'ranking.'"</p>

<p>That's exactly what we optimize for. Not traffic. Not rankings. <strong>Citations</strong>—the new currency of brand visibility in an AI-first world.</p>

<h2>The Practical Playbook: What to Do Next</h2>

<p>If you're realizing your current PR content strategy isn't built for AI search, here's your starting point:</p>

<h3>1. Audit Your Current Content Ecosystem</h3>

<p>Do you have a corporate newsroom that's regularly updated? Are your press releases structured with schema markup? Do you have FAQ pages that directly answer common questions? Is your thought leadership being published in places AI engines trust? Start with visibility into what you have—and what you're missing.</p>

<h3>2. Structure Everything for Machine Readability</h3>

<p>As <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/answer-engine-optimization-best-practices">HubSpot's recent AEO guide</a> explains, "At its core, answer engine optimization is the strategic practice of structuring your content so AI-powered systems can easily extract, understand, and present it as authoritative answers." This means HTML tables, bullet lists, FAQ formatting, and clear hierarchical structure in every piece of content.</p>

<h3>3. Build for Recency and Frequency</h3>

<p>Remember: 50% of AI citations come from content less than 11 months old. One press release per quarter isn't enough. You need regular content updates across your entire ecosystem—newsroom updates, FAQ additions, thought leadership pieces, and earned media campaigns that create ongoing citation opportunities.</p>

<h3>4. Track Citations, Not Just Traffic</h3>

<p>As <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/digiday-research-the-marketers-guide-to-ai-applications-agentic-ai-ai-search-and-geo-aeo-in-2026/">former IPG Media Lab managing director Adam Simon</a> told Digiday, "We've seen a slew of new companies like Profound, Evertune and Bluefish that are great at being AI brand monitoring firms." You need to know when AI engines mention your brand, even if users never click through to your website.</p>

<h3>5. Invest in Earned Media Strategy</h3>

<p>Press releases are the anchor. Earned media is the authority signal. According to <a href="https://redshoesinc.com/blog/press-releases-in-2026-how-to-get-your-announcement-quoted-in-ai-answers-not-just-indexed/">Red Shoes PR's analysis</a>, "The era of AI-generated answers makes press releases a critical tool, not just for journalists but for machines that guide client decisions." But those machines trust journalists more than they trust you. Build relationships. Earn coverage. Get cited.</p>

<p><strong>Stop guessing, start ranking.</strong> <a href="https://app.authoritytech.io/visibility-audit">Book your visibility audit</a> and see exactly where you stand in AI search results—and what it will take to dominate them.</p>

<h2>What Happens to PR Teams That Don't Adapt</h2>

<p>The Notified/Ragan webinar isn't a courtesy heads-up. It's a warning. PR teams that continue operating on a press-release-only model will see diminishing returns as AI search becomes the dominant discovery mechanism for their audiences.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.growth-rocket.com/blog/optimizing-press-releases-for-ai-engine-pickup/">Growth Rocket's recent analysis</a>, "AI engines favor content that provides contextual value to users over promotional material." If your press releases read like ads, AI engines will skip them. If your newsroom hasn't been updated in six months, AI engines won't trust it. If you don't have structured FAQs, thought leadership, and earned media reinforcing your narrative, AI engines will cite your competitors instead.</p>

<p>This isn't hypothetical. It's already happening. Brands with robust content ecosystems are capturing citations at exponentially higher rates than brands relying on quarterly press releases alone.</p>

<p>The question isn't whether the industry will adapt. The question is whether you'll adapt before your market share erodes.</p>

<h2>The Real Competitive Advantage: Being Early</h2>

<p>Here's the opportunity nobody's talking about yet: <strong>most of your competitors are just learning about this now.</strong> They're registering for the February 12 webinar. They're reading this blog post. They're starting to realize they need to rethink their entire content strategy.</p>

<p>But they haven't executed yet.</p>

<p>If you move now—while the industry is still in "awareness" mode—you can capture AI visibility before the market gets crowded. You can establish citation patterns while AI engines are still forming their authority assessments. You can build the content ecosystem that becomes the default reference for your industry.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/aeo-geo-benchmarks-report/">Conductor's benchmarks report</a>, early movers in AEO/GEO are seeing "total search performance and relevance" improvements that extend beyond traditional traffic metrics. They're capturing mindshare in AI-generated answers—the new battleground for brand awareness.</p>

<p>The window for being early is closing. By Q3 2026, when every PR team has implemented some version of what Notified teaches in their webinar, the bar will be significantly higher. The brands that act now will have a six-month head start that compounds over time.</p>


<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How is AI search changing PR?</h3>
