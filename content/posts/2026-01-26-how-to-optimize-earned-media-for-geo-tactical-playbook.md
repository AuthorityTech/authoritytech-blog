<p>Everyone's talking about Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Few are explaining how to actually do it.</p>

<p>Here's what most articles get wrong: they tell you earned media matters for AI search, then offer zero tactical guidance on how to optimize it. "Get mentioned in credible publications" isn't a strategy—it's a platitude.</p>

<p>This guide is different. We'll break down exactly how to structure earned media placements so AI systems cite and recommend your brand.</p>

<h2>Why Earned Media Dominates AI Search Results</h2>

<p>Before the tactics, let's understand why this matters.</p>

<p>Research from Muck Rack's Generative Pulse study found that <strong>85.5% of AI-generated citations come from earned media</strong>—not paid ads, not owned content. When ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini recommend a product or answer a question, they're pulling from third-party editorial coverage.</p>

<p>This creates a fundamental shift in visibility strategy:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional SEO:</strong> Optimize your website to rank in search results</li>
<li><strong>GEO:</strong> Get mentioned in sources that AI systems trust and cite</li>
</ul>

<p>The brands that invested in PR over the past 3-5 years are now being recommended by AI. The brands that didn't are invisible—no matter how good their on-page SEO is.</p>

<h2>The 7-Step Tactical Playbook</h2>

<h3>1. Target Publications AI Actually Cites</h3>

<p>Not all media coverage is equal for GEO. AI systems weight sources by authority, and that authority varies by topic.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Identify which publications AI cites for your category.</p>

<p>How to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini questions your customers would ask</li>
<li>Note which publications appear in citations</li>
<li>Cross-reference with your existing media targets</li>
</ul>

<p>For B2B tech, we typically see: TechCrunch, Forbes, Business Insider, VentureBeat, and industry-specific trade publications.</p>

<p><strong>The insight:</strong> A placement in a publication AI cites is worth 10x more than coverage in an outlet it ignores.</p>

<h3>2. Optimize Headlines for Query Matching</h3>

<p>AI systems match user queries to content. Your earned media headlines need to align with how people actually search.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Before pitching, research how your target audience phrases questions.</p>

<p><strong>Example transformation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generic headline: "Company X Raises $50M Series B"</li>
<li>GEO-optimized headline: "How Company X Is Solving [Specific Problem]: Inside Their $50M Growth Strategy"</li>
</ul>

<p>The second headline matches queries like "how to solve [problem]" and "best [solution] companies."</p>

<h3>3. Include Structured Data Points</h3>

<p>AI systems love extractable facts. The more concrete data points in your coverage, the more likely AI will cite it.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Seed every placement with quotable statistics and specific claims.</p>

<p>Strong data points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Percentages and growth metrics ("reduced costs by 47%")</li>
<li>Comparative claims ("3x faster than alternatives")</li>
<li>Industry benchmarks ("while the average is X, we achieved Y")</li>
<li>Named methodologies ("using our proprietary [Name] framework")</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> When someone asks "what's the best way to [do something]," AI systems look for specific, citable answers—not vague claims.</p>

<h3>4. Ensure Consistent Entity Information</h3>

<p>AI systems build "entity profiles" of brands by aggregating information across sources. Inconsistencies confuse them and reduce citation likelihood. (See also: <a href="https://blog.authoritytech.io/ai-search-traffic-worth-10x-google-traffic">Ai search traffic worth 10x google traffic</a>) (See also: <a href="https://blog.authoritytech.io/how-to-prove-pr-roi-beyond-vanity-metrics-2026">How to prove pr roi beyond vanity metrics</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Audit your brand mentions for consistency.</p>

<p>Check these elements across all coverage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company name (exact spelling, capitalization)</li>
<li>Founder/executive names and titles</li>
<li>Product names and descriptions</li>
<li>Category positioning (how you describe what you do)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Your website says "AI-powered analytics platform" but press coverage says "machine learning dashboard tool." AI systems see these as potentially different entities.

<h3>5. Build Topical Authority Clusters</h3>

<p>One placement doesn't establish authority. AI systems look for consistent expertise signals across multiple sources on the same topic.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Plan earned media campaigns around topic clusters, not one-off placements.</p>

<p>Example cluster for a cybersecurity company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placement 1: "How Zero-Trust Architecture Prevents Breaches" (TechCrunch)</li>
<li>Placement 2: "The Real Cost of Data Breaches in 2026" (Forbes)</li>
<li>Placement 3: "Why SMBs Are the New Target for Ransomware" (Inc)</li>
<li>Placement 4: Expert quote in broader industry roundup (WSJ)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The compounding effect:</strong> After 3-4 placements on the same topic, AI systems start associating your brand with that expertise area. You become the default citation.</p>

<h3>6. Optimize for Recency Signals</h3>

<p>AI systems weight recent content more heavily for time-sensitive queries. Your earned media strategy needs a recency component.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Maintain a consistent cadence of coverage, not just occasional spikes.</p>

<p>Recommended frequency:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-2 Tier 1 placements per quarter (Forbes, TechCrunch, etc.)</li>
<li>2-4 Tier 2 placements per month (industry trades, business publications)</li>
<li>Ongoing expert commentary and quotes in relevant stories</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> If your last major coverage was 18 months ago, AI systems may deprioritize you for current queries—even if that old coverage was excellent.</p>

<h3>7. Monitor and Iterate Based on AI Citations</h3>

<p>You can't optimize what you don't measure. Track when and how AI systems cite your brand.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Set up an AI citation monitoring system.</p>

<p>Manual monitoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly: Search your brand name + key queries in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini</li>
<li>Document: Which queries trigger citations? Which don't?</li>
<li>Analyze: What do cited placements have in common?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Iterate:</strong> Double down on what's getting cited. Adjust strategy for queries where competitors appear but you don't.</p>


<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What types of publications does AI cite most?</h3>
<p>AI systems frequently cite authoritative publications like TechCrunch, Forbes, Business Insider, VentureBeat, and industry-specific trade publications for B2B tech topics. These sources are often favored due to their perceived credibility and comprehensive coverage.</p>

<h3>How can I find out which publications AI cites?</h3>
<p>To identify which publications AI cites, ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini questions your target customers would ask. Note the publications that appear in the citations, and cross-reference them with your existing media targets to prioritize outreach.</p>

<h3>Why is earned media important for GEO?</h3>
<p>Earned media is crucial for GEO because AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini primarily pull information from third-party editorial coverage when recommending products or answering questions. This makes earned media a fundamental driver of AI visibility.</p>

<h3>What kind of data should I include in earned media?</h3>
<p>Incorporate quotable statistics, such as percentages and growth metrics (e.g., "reduced costs by 47%"), comparative claims (e.g., "3x faster than alternatives"), and industry benchmarks. Also, include named methodologies (e.g., "using our proprietary [Name] framework") to provide AI systems with specific, citable information.</p>

<h3>How do I optimize headlines for AI search?</h3>
<p>Optimize headlines by researching how your target audience phrases their questions and then aligning your headlines accordingly. For example, transform a generic headline like "Company X Raises $50M Series B" into a query-optimized version like "How Company X Is Solving [Specific Problem]: Inside Their $50M Growth Strategy."</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>GEO isn't about gaming AI systems—it's about building genuine authority that AI systems recognize and reward.</p>

<p>The brands winning in AI search aren't using tricks. They're systematically building credibility through strategic earned media, consistent messaging, and continuous optimization.</p>

<p>The tactical playbook above gives you the framework. The execution is up to you.</p>
